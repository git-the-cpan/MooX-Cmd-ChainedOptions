MooX-Cmd-ChainedOptions

    For applications using MooX::Cmd and MooX::Options,
    MooX::Cmd::ChainedOptions transparently provides access to command
    line options from further up the command chain.

    For example, if an application provides options at each level of the
    command structure:

      app --app-opt cmd --cmd-opt subcmd --subcmd-opt

    The subcmd object will have direct access to the "app_option" and
    "cmd_option" options via object attributes:

      sub execute {
          print $self->app_opt, "\n";
          print $self->cmd_opt, "\n";
          print $self->subcmd_opt, "\n";
      }
